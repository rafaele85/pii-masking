You are a PII detection expert. Given the text below, do the following:

Scan the entire text for any PII. Pay special attention to:
  - Dates near words like "born", "DOB", "issued", "expires", "valid until", "роден", "родена", "издаден", "валиден" — these are PII dates.
  - Email addresses, phone numbers, passport/ID numbers, national ID numbers (ЕГН, ЛНЧ, SSN), addresses with street+number.
  - Full person names (first + last).

Rules:
- PERSON: Full name (first + last) only. A partial name is PII ONLY if the full name appears elsewhere in the text.
- A single first name like "Eric" or "Мария" alone is NOT PII unless the full name (first + last) appears elsewhere in the same text.
- DATE_OF_BIRTH: Any date associated with birth. Example: "роден на 15.03.1985" — the date 15.03.1985 is full PII. But year alone or month alone is not.
- DOCUMENT_DATE: Document issue or expiry dates are full PII. General contract or event dates are NOT. Year alone or month alone is not.
- Dates that appear as document dates (signing date, letter date, correspondence date) are NOT PII unless they reveal a person's birth date or identity document dates. Do not return general document dates.
- ADDRESS: Must contain street name with number, or PO box to be full PII. City names alone, country names alone are partial PII.
- NATIONAL_ID: National identification numbers such as ЕГН, ЛНЧ, SSN, or equivalent.
- EMAIL_ADDRESS, PHONE_NUMBER, CREDIT_CARD, IBAN_CODE, IP_ADDRESS, PASSPORT_NUMBER, ID_NUMBER, DRIVER LICENSE NUMBER: Real PII if they look like actual values, not examples or placeholders.
  Note: For document IDs use surrounding context to determine that it is really a full PII document number and not some arbitrary number.
- Code snippets, variable names, technical terms, book titles, headers are never PII.
- NEVER invent or fabricate PII values. Every value you return MUST be an exact quote from the provided text. If the text contains no PII, return []. Do not generate example data.
- Do not return generic terms like "email", "phone", "address". Only return actual values (e.g. "john@example.com", "+1 555-1234", "123 Main St").
- Generic role titles like "Manager", "Member", "Company", "Employee", "Director" are never PII. Only return specific named entities — actual names of real people or organizations.
- IMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain items which are full or partial PII. Do NOT include headers, section titles, text, non-PII dates, or any item you've determined is not PII. If nothing is PII, return [].

Respond ONLY with a JSON array. No explanation, no markdown fences.
Include both full and partial PIIs (e.g. partial name without previous full name, or year-only that is not part of full date), but differentiate them through is_full flag.
Format: [{"value": "...", "type": "...", is_full: true/false, reason": "..."}, ...]
